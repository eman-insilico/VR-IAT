The is a Virtual Reality recreation of the Harvard Implicit Association Test (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) with a twist: by using the Quest Hand Tracking, you can do the test with either white skin or black skin hands.

From my testing so far, the 'black hands mode' has consistently reduced my bias and preference for white people by around 10 to 15% (reduces the time it takes me to associate ‘Black’ and ‘Good’ by 2 -5 seconds). Hard to tell if this has any real long-term effects, however. 

If you are willing to share your results and help with gathering more data, please email me at emanueltomozei11@gmail.com. Please include your race and the results (including the times displayed) for the tests done with both white and black hands.
